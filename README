DBIx/Migrate version 0.01
=========================

SYNOPSIS
       use DBI;
       use DBIx::Migrate;

       $source = DBI->connect('dbi:Oracle:dbase1', ...);

       $target = DBI->connect('dbi:mysql:dbase2', ...);

       $migration =
           DBIx::Migrate->new(SOURCE => $source,
                              TARGET => $target,
           # optional         CLOBBER => 1,
                              TABLES => [ qw(tbl1 tb12 ..etc..) ]
           # optional         TYPE_TRANSLATE => $hash_ref
                             );

       $tables_copied = $migration->migrate;

DESCRIPTION
       DBIx::Migrate is a DBI extension for 'batch-mode' table migration.
       Let's suppose you want to create a MySQL mirror of several related
       tables in an Oracle database.  DBIx::Migrate will do just that.  If the
       target MySQL table does not exist, an attempt is made to create a MySQL
       version of the original Oracle table structure.  The big problem here
       is that not all databases use universal data types.  So depending on
       the driver, you'll probably need to alter the TYPE_TRANSLATE parameter.
       By default, the TYPE_TRANSLATE parameter looks like this:

       TYPE_TRANSLATE = { qw!  1 char 2 numeric 3 decimal 4 integer 5 smallint
       6 float 7 real 8 double 9 date 10 time 11 timestamp 12 varchar -1 text
       -2 binary -3 varbinary -4 blob -5 bigint -6 tinyint -7 bit -8 wchar -9
       wvarchar -10 wlongvarchar ! };

       Please note that DBIx::Migrate does not create indexes on target
       tables.  You'll have to do that by hand.

       Also, a fatal error will result if you attempt to create a table that
       already exists in the target database.  If you want to override this
       behavior, set the CLOBBER parameter to true.
